Welcome to the Adaptive Robotics Lab at [UIC](https://cs.uic.edu/)!

We aim to develop fundamental technologies that enable robots to understand their contacts with the external world from proactive interactions and perform meaningful tasks. Our research topics include physics-based perception/world modeling, active learning, and contact-rich manipulation planning. Applications of our research include construction, nursing, healthcare, and scientific exploration.
